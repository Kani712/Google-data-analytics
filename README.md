During each course of the program, you will complete lots of hands-on assignments and projects based on both day-to-day life and the practical activities of a data analyst. Along the way, you will learn how to ask the right questions and understand objectives. You will also learn how to effectively clean and organize large amounts of data to make it ready for high-quality analysis. On top of that, you will get hands-on experience using all kinds of tools and techniques that will help you recognize patterns and uncover relationships between data points. And to help you communicate the results of your analysis, you will learn how to design visuals and dashboards. There is even an opportunity to create a case study, which you can highlight in your resume to show what you have learned to potential employers.

## Overview

>> Now that you have been introduced to working with data, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about the data analysis process and data life cycle, then respond to brief questions. 

>> This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of the phases of data analysis to your data analysis toolbox. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Review the phases of data

So far you’ve learned about the data analysis process and the data life cycle. They include the following steps:

## Data Analysis Process:
* Ask

* Prepare

* Process

* Analyze

* Share

* Act

## Data Life Cycle:
* Plan

* Capture

* Manage

* Analyze

* Archive

* Destroy

For a refresher on the phases of data, you can review the reading on the [data analysis process](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/Yo3Cn/the-data-analysis-process-and-this-program) and [the video on the data life cycle.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/mhEHY/phases-of-the-data-life-cycle)

## Reflection

> Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:

>> * What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

>> - The relationship between data analysis and the life cycle is in the data life cycle we identify and manage data, in the data analysis process we come to a data-driven decision from the data collected.
>> - similarity is both processes involve a series of steps to conclude and both processes involve data. The key difference is that in the data life cycle we decide on what data is needed,d, the ways to collect it, and manage and store them for later use. it also focuses on how to secure the data. In the data analysis process we focus on achieving business goals and we come to that conclusion on how to solve a problem through the findings.

>> * What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

>> - The relationship between the Ask and plan phase is that the data analyst plans what data is needed, who will be responsible to address the problem to be solved. The planning helps us to learn during the asking phase.
>> - Both phases as the right questions on what is needed to be done. it is the first step for both processes.
>> - Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of goals that need to be achieved like, what data is needed, how to manage the data, and so on. whereas in the Ask phase of the data analysis process data analyst focuses on strategic thinking on what is a problem needs to be solved and what kind of data is required to analyze to find a solution to the problem.
